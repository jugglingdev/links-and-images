    <p>This particular page is about links!  There are three kinds of links:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Absolute links, like to
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Develop Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="extras.html">extras page</a></li>
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the home page of a website hosted on a web server, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
      <!-- Root-relative links start with a / to represent the root of the site -->
    </ul>
